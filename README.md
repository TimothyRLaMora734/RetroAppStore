# RetroAppStore

macOS Mojave 10.14 comes with a brand-new redesigned App Store. While some people loves it, others dislike the latest design of the Mac App Store. RetroAppStore is what you need. It patches the High Sierra Mac App Store to make it compatible with macOS Mojave and later, and you can use it as the default App Store for downloading apps and games.

## Requirements
- macOS 10.14 or later (This app haven't been tested on 10.15 yet).

## Issues
- Currently, the patched Mac App Store is only capable of downloading and installing applications, but not updating them. (To update apps you have to use the new App Store).

## How to use
- Download the latest release
- Unzip the zipped file.
- Run "RetroAppStore.app"

After running the app, there will be an app called "HS App Store" in your Applications folder (`/Applications/HS App Store.app`).
